I am a first year graduate student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I completed my undergaduate education from the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad ([IITH](https://iith.ac.in/)) in Electrical Engineering, along 
with a second major in Computer Science and Engineering. I love exploring the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning (there was a time, long, long ago,
where this wouldn't sound as vague as it does now. Alas!) and attempting to bridge the gap between theory and practice, developing models and algorithms
with mathematical guarantees. Diverging from the nerdy stuff, I thoroughly enjoy playing and watching football (soccer, for those who prefer it that way),
basketball, and table tennis (or ping-pong; if I had a nickel for every time this happened, I'd have two nickels- which isn't a lot, but it's weird that 
it happened twice- Dr. Doofenshmirtz, probably).

## Work Experience

I completed a summer internship at NVIDIA in the summer of 2024, where I worked on non-convex computational geometry problems and graph-partitioning 
heuristics for chip design. At IITH, I was a Research Assistant to [Dr. Aditya Siripuram](https://people.iith.ac.in/staditya/). Spanning about 30 months,
I worked on Non-convex robust PCA, Matrix Factorization, Orthogonal Dictionary Learning, Householder Matrices- their richness in the orthogonal group,
utility in signal processing as well as in normalizing flows, and matrix rigidity. I also worked under the guidance 
[Dr. Lakshmi Prasad Natarajan](https://people.iith.ac.in/lakshminatarajan/) for about 12 months on Algebraic Error Correcting Codes. This was supported
by the Qualcomm 6G University India Research Program. Some of this work has been presented in greater detail in the publications and projects sections.

## Teaching

I was a Teaching Assistant for the courses Matrix Theory, Semiconductor Device Fundamentals, Vector Calculus, Probability Theory, Convex Optimization,
and Differential Equations & Transform Techniques. A big thanks to all the professors who allowed me to take up these roles, and especially, the hundreds
of students with whom I've interacted along the way!
